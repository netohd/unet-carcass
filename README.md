# unet_carcass

This work proposes the implementation of the U-Net \cite{ronneberger2015u} for training a model capable of segmenting 3 (three) beef carcass cut classes, contributing to the process of measuring and optimizing the slaughter line. Through the automatic segmentation of the 3 classes (Rear, Rib and Front), satisfactory levels in the performance of the model can represent a significant gain in production efficiency.
